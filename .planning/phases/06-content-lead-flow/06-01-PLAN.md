# Plan 06-01: Content & Lead Flow

## Objective
Implement partner messaging and consultation conversion path. Add form-based lead capture while preserving phone call CTAs. Strengthen partner vs vendor positioning throughout.

## Execution Context
- **Phase**: 6 — Content & Lead Flow
- **Estimated scope**: Medium (8 tasks)
- **Dependencies**: Phase 5 complete (demo UI in place)
- **Checkpoints**: None (fully autonomous)

## Context

### Current State
- All CTAs link to phone call (`tel:`) or scroll anchors
- No form-based lead capture exists
- Partner messaging is implicit but not explicit
- UseCases shows system phases but limited industry context
- HowItWorks shows Discover→Design→Deploy partner flow

### Decisions Made
- **Form handling**: Formspree (free tier, no backend required, static-site compatible)
- **Form placement**: Replace FinalCTA phone-only section with form + phone option
- **Partner messaging**: Emphasize "build with you" vs "sell to you" language
- **Industry showcase**: Add industry examples inline to UseCases (no separate pages)

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/FinalCTA.jsx` — Add consultation form
- `src/components/Hero.jsx` — Strengthen partner messaging
- `src/components/UseCases.jsx` — Add industry examples
- `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx` — Enhance partnership language
- `src/constants/config.js` — Add Formspree endpoint config

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add Formspree configuration
**Type**: feat
**File**: `src/constants/config.js`

Add Formspree endpoint configuration to centralized config:
- Add `FORM.endpoint` placeholder (Formspree URL)
- Add `FORM.fields` for field validation configuration
- Keep it environment-variable ready for production

**Acceptance**:
- Config exports FORM object with endpoint
- Works with placeholder during development

---

### Task 2: Create ConsultationForm component
**Type**: feat
**Files**: `src/components/ConsultationForm.jsx`

Build brutalist-styled form component:
- Fields: name, email, company, phone (optional), message
- Match existing design system (borders, shadows, typography)
- Form validation with inline error states
- Loading state during submission
- Success/error feedback states
- Accessible labels and ARIA attributes

**Acceptance**:
- Form renders with brutalist styling
- All fields have proper labels and validation
- States (idle, loading, success, error) display correctly

---

### Task 3: Integrate form into FinalCTA section
**Type**: feat
**File**: `src/components/FinalCTA.jsx`

Replace phone-only CTA with dual option:
- Keep phone CTA prominent (primary action)
- Add ConsultationForm as alternative ("Prefer email?")
- Two-column layout on desktop: form left, phone CTA right
- Stack on mobile with phone first
- Section title: "Ready to Build Your AI System?"

**Acceptance**:
- Form displays alongside phone option
- Responsive layout works on all screens
- Both CTAs are clearly accessible

---

### Task 4: Implement form submission handling
**Type**: feat
**File**: `src/components/ConsultationForm.jsx`

Add Formspree submission logic:
- POST to Formspree endpoint from config
- Handle success: show confirmation message
- Handle error: show retry message with details
- No page reload (fetch API)
- Track submission state in component

**Acceptance**:
- Form submits to Formspree without page reload
- Success state shows "Thank you" message
- Error state shows actionable message

---

### Task 5: Strengthen Hero partner messaging
**Type**: refactor
**File**: `src/components/Hero.jsx`

Update Hero copy to emphasize partnership:
- Subheadline: Add "Built with your team" or similar
- Trust line: Add "Systems Partner" language
- Keep headline focused on results ("AI That Works")

**Acceptance**:
- Hero copy reflects partner positioning
- Changes are subtle, not disruptive to existing flow

---

### Task 6: Add industry examples to UseCases
**Type**: feat
**File**: `src/components/UseCases.jsx`

Enhance UseCases with industry context:
- Add 2-3 industry examples per use case (e.g., "Healthcare", "Finance", "Manufacturing")
- Display as tags below feature list
- Keep existing card structure intact
- Use subtle styling (text-mono, slate colors)

**Acceptance**:
- Each use case shows relevant industries
- Styling matches brutalist system
- Cards don't become cluttered

---

### Task 7: Enhance HowItWorks partnership language
**Type**: refactor
**File**: `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx`

Update step descriptions to emphasize collaboration:
- Discover: "We map your workflows together..."
- Design: "We build your system architecture..."
- Deploy: "We roll out with your team..."
- Add section intro about "building with, not selling to"

**Acceptance**:
- Step copy uses collaborative "we" language
- Partnership positioning is clear without being heavy-handed

---

### Task 8: Update Header CTA for form section
**Type**: refactor
**File**: `src/components/Header.jsx`

Update "Book Demo" button to scroll to form:
- Change href from "#book" to "#consult" (new section ID)
- Update button text to "Get Started" or "Consult"
- Ensure smooth scroll behavior

**Acceptance**:
- Header CTA scrolls to consultation form
- Button text reflects action

## Verification
After all tasks complete:
1. Form submission works (check Formspree dashboard or test endpoint)
2. Partner messaging is consistent across Hero, HowItWorks, UseCases
3. Mobile responsive layout for form section
4. Accessibility: form labels, focus states, error announcements
5. Dev server runs without errors

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ConsultationForm component created with brutalist styling
- [ ] Form integrated into FinalCTA with phone option preserved
- [ ] Form submission works via Formspree
- [ ] Partner messaging strengthened in Hero, HowItWorks, UseCases
- [ ] Industry examples added to UseCases
- [ ] Header CTA updated to target form section
- [ ] All changes respect design system and accessibility standards

## Output
- ConsultationForm.jsx created
- FinalCTA.jsx updated with form integration
- Hero.jsx, HowItWorks.jsx, UseCases.jsx updated with messaging
- Header.jsx updated with new CTA target
- config.js updated with form configuration
