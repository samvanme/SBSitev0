# Plan 06-01: Content Messaging & Consultation Form

<objective>
Update content messaging across all sections to position StrataBlue as a consulting partner (not tool vendor), and implement a consultation form with lead capture to replace phone-only CTAs.
</objective>

<execution_context>
**Phase**: 6 — Content & Lead Flow
**Estimated scope**: Medium (12 tasks)
**Dependencies**: Design system (Phase 2), Section styling (Phase 3)
**Builds on**: Brutalist component patterns, existing section structure
</execution_context>

<context>
## Current State

From discovery:
- All CTAs use `tel:` links — no forms exist
- Messaging focuses on "voice agents" and "CRM integration" (tool-centric)
- "Schedule Call" button in FinalCTA points to `#demo` (wrong target)
- Footer links are non-interactive `<span>` elements
- No form submission handling

## Target State

Per PROJECT.md and ROADMAP:
- **Partner positioning**: "Consultation + end-to-end AI solutions partner (not a tool vendor)"
- **Solution narrative**: Strategy → implementation (consultants who build)
- **Lead capture**: Consultation form integrated into experience
- **Consultation-first model**: No pricing, all leads through consultation

## Key Decisions (from STATE.md)

- Form submission: Client-side with API endpoint stub (backend TBD)
- No pricing — consultation-first model confirmed
- No separate industry pages — unified experience

## Files to Modify

</context>

<tasks>

## Part A: Partner Messaging Updates

### Task 1: Update Hero messaging for partner positioning
**File**: `src/components/Hero.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Headline: Shift from "AI That Works Inside Your CRM" to partner-focused value prop
- Suggested: "AI Systems. Built to Fit." or "Your AI Partner. Not Another Tool."
- Subheadline: Emphasize strategy + implementation, not just voice agents
- Trust line: Add "Strategy to Production" or similar consulting language

**Keep**: Brutalist styling, animation behavior, responsive layout

### Task 2: Update HowItWorks with consulting narrative
**File**: `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Section headline: Emphasize end-to-end partnership
- Step descriptions: Highlight consulting expertise, not just process
- Step 1 (Discover): Strategy + roadmapping, not just "map workflows"
- Step 2 (Design): Architecture + integration planning with your team
- Step 3 (Deploy): Ongoing support, measurement, iteration
- CTA: "Start a Conversation" or "Book Discovery Call"

### Task 3: Update UseCases with solutions framing
**File**: `src/components/UseCases.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Section headline: "AI Solutions by Domain" or "Where AI Fits"
- Card framing: Solutions we build together, not features you buy
- Preserve Phase 1/2/3 structure but soften the product-ness
- Add brief capability mention (voice, chat, automation, analytics)

### Task 4: Update Stats section with partnership value
**File**: `src/components/Stats.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Section headline: Connect results to partnership approach
- Testimonial: Adjust to emphasize collaborative relationship
- Keep the same numbers ($680K, 45 Days, etc.) — these are strong

## Part B: Consultation Form

### Task 5: Add email and form endpoint to config
**File**: `src/constants/config.js`
**Changes**:
```javascript
export const CONTACT = {
  phone: '+13179612546',
  phoneDisplay: '317-961-2546',
  email: 'hello@stratablue.ai',  // Add email
};

export const API = {
  consultationEndpoint: '/api/consultation',  // Stub for future backend
};
```

### Task 6: Create ConsultationForm component
**File**: NEW `src/components/ConsultationForm.jsx`
**Features**:
- Fields: Name, Email, Company, Phone (optional), Message/Challenge
- Brutalist styling: thick borders, hard shadows, no rounded corners
- Accessible: proper labels, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- States: idle, submitting, success, error
- Mobile-responsive: full-width inputs on small screens
- Form submission: POST to API endpoint with graceful fallback

**Styling reference**: Match FinalCTA and other brutalist components

### Task 7: Add form submission handler hook
**File**: NEW `src/hooks/useFormSubmission.js`
**Features**:
- Handles form state (idle, submitting, success, error)
- POST to configurable endpoint
- Graceful error handling with user feedback
- Optional: localStorage backup of submission for offline resilience
- Returns: `{ submit, status, error, reset }`

### Task 8: Integrate ConsultationForm into FinalCTA
**File**: `src/components/FinalCTA.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Replace "Schedule Call" button with inline form OR
- Add form below existing CTAs as alternative path
- Keep phone CTA for users who prefer calling
- Update headline: "Let's Talk" or "Start a Conversation"
- Form positioned within the brutalist card aesthetic

## Part C: CTA Updates & Lead Flow

### Task 9: Update Hero CTAs
**File**: `src/components/Hero.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Primary CTA: Keep "Try AI Agent Now" (phone) OR change to form anchor
- Secondary CTA: "Book a Call" → scrolls to FinalCTA form section
- Ensure smooth scroll behavior

### Task 10: Update HowItWorks CTA
**File**: `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx`
**Changes**:
- CTA text: "Start a Conversation" or "Book Discovery Call"
- Link target: `#book` (FinalCTA section with form)

### Task 11: Update UseCases CTAs
**File**: `src/components/UseCases.jsx`
**Changes**:
- "Learn More" links: Point to `#book` with context parameter OR
- Remove if not adding per-solution detail (keep simple for v1)

### Task 12: Update Footer with working contact
**File**: `src/components/Footer.jsx`
**Changes**:
- Add email link: `mailto:${CONTACT.email}`
- Keep phone number link
- Consider: "Contact" link in nav pointing to `#book`

3. Commit with message: `feat(06): add partner messaging and consultation form`
</output>

<notes>
## Form Backend Decision (Deferred)

Form submission handling is stubbed for now. Backend options to decide later:
- **Serverless function** (Vercel/Netlify): Simple, no infrastructure
- **CRM integration** (HubSpot, Salesforce): Lead goes directly to sales
- **Email forwarding** (Formspree, FormSubmit): Zero infrastructure
- **Custom API**: Full control, requires backend deployment

For this plan, form POSTs to `/api/consultation` and shows success state regardless (frontend complete, backend TBD).

## Content Tone

Shift from:
- "AI voice agents for revenue and service operations"
- "Integrated with your systems"

To:
- "AI systems designed around your operations"
- "Strategy, implementation, and ongoing partnership"
- "Consultants who build — not vendors who sell"

The goal: visitor leaves understanding StrataBlue is a team they work WITH, not a product they buy.
